## 2. AnimalKingdom




## 3. Omaprojekti1




## 4. Bullet solution

Bullet solution is a collection of services and clients such as BulletLibrary, BulletWebApplication and Reloading.Services.
Each component plays a part in making the application work as intended.

The purpose of BulletLibrary and other clients/services is to contain information and elements for the app that components might need to function, such as diameter and mass.
_Reloading (inserting information to a database) for example, only works if it gets what it needs from the BulletLibrary and other services._

What has been implemented: Web page to display and insert bullet data to a database.

### Changelog /// Current objectives:
1. Figure out what is causing the Blazor web application to not function properly.
the cause: Something added/or not properly implemented with Caliber and its components is causing the web application to crash.
Edit EntityCaliberService.cs and possibly EntityDiameterService.cs
